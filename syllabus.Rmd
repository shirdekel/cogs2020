# course philosophy
No Lectures: The worst method for transmitting information
from my head to yours is for me to lecture you. There are no
lectures. We work on problems together during class. You
learn soccer with the ball at your feet. You learn about
data with your hands on the keyboard.

R Everyday: Learning a new programming language is like
learning a new human language: You will practice (almost)
every day.

Community: You will probably learn the names of more
students in this course than in all your other courses
combined. Awkwardness in the pursuit of community is no
vice.

Professionalism: We use professional tools. Your workflow
will be very similar to the workflow involved in paid
employment. Your problem sets and final project will be
public, the better to impress others with your abilities.
High quality work will be shared with your classmates. We
will learn the "full cycle" of how to draw inferences from
data and communicate those inferences to others.

Cold Calling: I call on students during class. This keeps
every student involved, makes for a more lively discussion
and helps to prepare students for the real world, in which
you can’t hide in the back row. Want to be left alone? Don’t
take this course.

Advisory Groups: We do not have normal sections. Instead,
you will spend 30 minutes each week meeting with your
assigned TF in a small group. Recall what I just said about
(not) being left alone in this course.

Teaching to Learn: My main goal is not to teach you how do
X. That is easy! More importantly, in a few months, I won’t
be around to teach you Y. My goal is to teach you how to
teach yourself, how to figure out X and Y and Z on your own.
That is harder! Much of the pedagogy of the course —
especially my insistence that you work on topics not covered
in lecture — is driven by this goal. You will find it
frustrating.
