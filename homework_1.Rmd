## 1. Criterion learning experiment

Consider an experiment designed to find out whether or not
feedback-delay impairs criterion learning? What is criterion
learning? Here is an example trial:

<center>
![FigName](img/cats.png){width=250px}
</center>

In this case, thin bars belong to category A, and thick bars
belong to category B. But where exactly is the category
boundary (i.e., criterion) that separates thick from thin?
Criterion learning is the process that allows our brains to
figure this out.   Next, you will perform a cursory analysis
on the data from this experiment.

### a. 
Read
`https://crossley.github.io/cogs2020/data/criterion_learning/crit_learn.csv`
into a `data.table` and store the result in a variable named
`ans_1a`.

The resulting `data.table` contains the following columns:

- `t`: Trial number across the entire experiment.

- `t_prob`: Trial number per problem.

- `sub`: Subject identifier (i.e., different numbers correspond to different
  subjects).

- `cnd`: Condition identifier.

- `prob_num`: Problem number (gets increased by 1 every time a participant
  solves a problem).

- `t2c`: Trials to criterion (i.e., the number of trials it took a participant
  to solve a particular problem.)

- `exp`: Experiment indicator. Overall, this study was broken down into two
  experiments -- one using sine-wave grating stimuli and the other using a
  different type of stimuli.

- `nps`: Number of problems solved. This is the same as `max(prob_num)`

### b. 
Select only rows for which `cnd == Delay` or for which `cnd
== Long ITI` and store the result in a variable named
`ans_1b`.

### c. 
Starting with `ans_1b`, create a new `data.table` that
contains only a `cnd`, `sub` and mean `t2c` per `cnd` per
`sub`, and store the result in a variable named `ans_1c`.

* Make sure that your resulting `data.table` has only `cnd`,
`sub` and `t2c` columns and nothing more. Any columns named
`V1` etc. will lead to this question being marked
incorrect).

* Also make sure that your resulting `data.frame` only has
one observation per subject. Failure to do so will lead to
this question being marked incorrect.

### d. 
Use `ans_1c` and `ggplot` to reproduce the following plot
exactly and store the resulting `ggplot` object in a
variable named `ans_1d`.
    
```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
rm(list=ls())
d <- fread('https://crossley.github.io/cogs2020/data/criterion_learning/crit_learn.csv')
d <- d[cnd %in% c('Delay', 'Long ITI')]
dd <- d[, .(t2c = mean(t2c)), .(cnd, sub)]
g <- ggplot(dd, aes(cnd, t2c)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_point()
g
```


## 2. Rat maze experiment

Consider an experiment in which a set of rats run through a
set of mazes some number of times each. The researchers
running this experiment are interested in how quickly rats
can run these mazes, and so they record the `time` in
seconds each `rat` takes to complete each `run` of each
`maze`. Next, you will perform a cursory analysis on the
data from this experiment.

### a. 
Read
`https://crossley.github.io/cogs2020/data/maze/maze.csv`
into a `data.table` and store the result in a variable named
`ans_2a`.

The resulting `data.table` contains the following columns:

- `rat`: Rat identifier (i.e., different numbers correspond
to different rats).

- `maze`: Maze identifier (i.e., different numbers
correspond to different mazes).

- `run`: Run identifier (i.e., different numbers correspond
to different runs).

- `time`: The time in seconds taken to complete the maze.

### b.
`rat` and `maze` are both `categorical` experimental
factors, but they are currently coded as `numeric`. Inside
the `data.table`, change the coding of `rat` and `maze` to
`factor` and store the result in a variable named `ans_2b`.

### c. 
Starting with `ans_2b`, create a new `data.table` that
contains only a `maze`, `rat` and mean `time` per `maze` per
`rat`, and store the result in a variable named `ans_2c`.

* Make sure that your resulting `data.table` has only
`maze`, `rat` and `time` columns and nothing more. Any
columns named `V1` etc. will lead to this question being
marked incorrect).

* Also make sure that your resulting `data.frame` only has
one observation per `rat` per `maze`. Failure to do so will
lead to this question being marked incorrect.

### d. 
Use `ans_2c` and `ggplot` to reproduce the following plot
exactly and store the resulting `ggplot` object in a
variable named `ans_2d`.

```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
rm(list=ls())
d <- fread('https://crossley.github.io/cogs2020/data/maze/maze.csv')
d[, rat := as.factor(rat)]
d[, maze := as.factor(maze)]
dd <- d[, .(time = mean(time)), .(maze, rat)]
g <- ggplot(dd, aes(maze, time)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point()
g
```

## 3. Motor learning experiment
Consider an experiment designed to discover differences in
the sensorimotor learning abilities of expert minimally
invasive surgeons as compared to healthy college aged
controls. On each trial, participants simply rested their
hand in the middle of a desk, and then tried to move their
hand quickly and accurately to a visual target somewhere on
a circle centred at their hand position and with a radius of
about 8 cm. The data file can be found here at
`https://crossley.github.io/cogs2020/data/mis/mis_data.csv`
and contains the following columns:

* `subject`: Anonymous subject ID
* `group`: Indicates college student or surgeon
* `phase`: Indicates the phase of the experiment
* `trial`: Trial number
* `target`: The visual target was reached to for this trial
* `error`: The mismatch between the centre of the target and the final hand position
* `movement_time`: How long the movement lasted
* `reaction_time`: How long until the movement began
* `peak_velocity`: The maximum velocity reached during the reach
* `hand_angle`: The angle of the hand movement

### a. 
Compute the mean `hand_angle` per `group` per `trial` and
store the result in a variable named `ans_3a`.

### b. 
Use `ans_3a` and `ggplot` to reproduce the following plot
exactly and store the resulting `ggplot` object in a
variable named `ans_3b`.

```{r message=F, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
rm(list=ls())

d <- fread('https://crossley.github.io/cogs2020/data/mis/mis_data.csv')
d[, group := as.factor(group)]
dd <- d[, .(hand_angle = mean(hand_angle)), .(group, trial)]
g <- ggplot(dd, aes(trial, hand_angle, colour=group)) +
  geom_line()
g
```

## 4. MEG experiment
Consider an magnetoencephalography (MEG) experiment that
collected data from a single participant while they
performed a category learning experiment (see problem 1 for
example stimuli and an example trial). On each trial of the
category learning experiment, the participant viewed a
circular sine wave grating, and had to push a button to
indicate whether they believed the stimulus belonged to
category A or category B.

MEG is used to record the time-series of magnetic and
electric potentials at the scalp, which are generated by the
activity of neurons. There are many sensors, each configured
to pick up signal from a different position on the scalp.
This is shown in the following figure (the text labels
indicate the channel name and are placed approximately where
the MEG sensor is located on a real head).

<center>
![FigName](img/MEG_2.png){width=300px}
</center>

The data file that we will be working with is arranged into
*epochs* aligned to stimulus presentation. This means that
every time a stimulus is presented we say that an epoch has
occurred. We then assign a time of $t=0$ to the exact moment
the stimulus appeared. We then typically look at the neural
time series from just before the stimulus appeared to a
little while after the stimulus has appeared. For this data,
each epoch starts 0.1 seconds before stimulus onset, and
concludes 0.3 seconds after stimulus onset. The following
figure shows the MEG signal at every sensory location across
the entire scalp for 5 time points within this $[-0.1s,
0.3s]$ interval.

<center>
![FigName](img/MEG_1.png){width=550px}
</center>

The data can be located
at`https://crossley.github.io/cogs2020/data/eeg/epochs.txt`
and contains the following columns:

* The `time` column contains times in seconds relative to
stimulus onset. Stimulus onset always occurs at $0$ seconds.

* The `condition` column indicates which category the
stimulus belonged to for the given `epoch`. We won't make
use of this column here, and we will remove it below.

* The `epoch` column is the epoch number. You can think of
this like we have usually thought of `trial` columns in
examples throughout the course.

* The many different `MEG xyz` columns contain the actual
neural time series signals for each sensor. See the above
figure for how these column names map onto scalp positions.

### a. 
Load this data into a `data.table`, remove column `V1`, and
convert `condition` from an `int` to a `factor`. Store the
result in variable named `ans_4a`.

### b.
Convert `ans_4a` to *long format* using the `melt()`
function. Use `time`, `epoch`, and `condition` as `id.vars`
and store the result in a variable named `ans_4b`.

### c. 
Filter `ans_4b` such that it only contains rows
corresponding to the `MEG 001` channel and store the result
in a variable named `ans_4c`.

### d. 
From `ans_4c` compute the mean MEG signal separately per
`condition` and per `time` and store the result in a
variable named `ans_4d`.
  
### e. 
Use `ggplot` to reproduce the following plot exactly and
store the resulting `ggplot` object in a variable named
`ans_4e`.

```{r message=F, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
rm(list=ls())
d <- fread('https://crossley.github.io/cogs2020/data/eeg/epochs.txt')
d[, V1 := NULL]
d[, condition := as.factor(condition)]
dd <- melt(d, id.vars=c('time', 'epoch', 'condition'))
dd <- dd[variable == 'MEG 001']
ddd <- dd[, .(value = mean(value)), .(condition, time)]
g <- ggplot(ddd, aes(time, value, colour=condition)) + 
  geom_line()
g
```
