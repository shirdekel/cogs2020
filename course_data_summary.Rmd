## Rat maze data

Consider an experiment in which a set of rats run through a set of mazes some
number of times each. The researchers running this experiment are interested in
how quickly rats can run these mazes, and so they record the `time` in seconds
each `rat` takes to complete each `run` of each `maze`.

```{r message=F}

rm(list=ls())

d <- fread('https://crossley.github.io/cogs2020/data/maze/maze.csv')

```

The resulting `data.table` contains the following columns:

- `rat`: Rat identifier (i.e., different numbers correspond to different rats).

- `maze`: Maze identifier (i.e., different numbers correspond to different mazes).

- `run`: Run identifier (i.e., different numbers correspond to different runs).

- `time`: The time in seconds taken to complete the maze.


## Criterion learning data

- Does feedback-delay impair criterion learning?

- What is criterion learning? Here is an example trial.

<center>
![FigName](img/cats.png){width=350px}
</center>

- In this case, thin bars belong to category A, and thick bars belong to
  category B.

- Bar thickness is continuous... when exactly does thick become thin?

- Where is the category boundary (i.e., criterion) that separates thick from
  thin?

- Criterion learning is the process that allows our brains to figure this out.

```{r message=F}

rm(list=ls())

d <- fread('https://crossley.github.io/cogs2020/data/criterion_learning/crit_learn.csv')

```

The resulting `data.table` contains the following columns:

- `t`: Trial number across the entire experiment.

- `t_prob`: Trial number per problem.

- `sub`: Subject identifier (i.e., different numbers correspond to different
  subjects).

- `cnd`: Condition identifier.

- `prob_num`: Problem number (gets increased by 1 every time a participant
  solves a problem).

- `t2c`: Trials to criterion (i.e., the number of trials it took a participant
  to solve a particular problem.)

- `exp`: Experiment indicator. Overall, this study was broken down into two
  experiments -- one using sine-wave grating stimuli and the other using a
  different type of stimuli.

- `nps`: Number of problems solved. This is the same as `max(prob_num)`


## NHP data
The data file can be found here:
https://crossley.github.io/cogs2020/data//nhp_cat_learn/ii_gabor.csv

This data file contains the results from a monkey performing a category learning
experiment similar to those that we have seen a handful of times already in this
class. On each trial of the experiment the monkey sees a sine-wave grating and
must learn through trial and error whether that grating is a member of category
A or category B.

```{r message=F}

rm(list=ls())

d <- fread('https://crossley.github.io/cogs2020/data//nhp_cat_learn/ii_gabor.csv')

col_names <- c(
  'cat',
  'x',
  'y',
  'resp',
  'rt',
  'phase'
)

setnames(d, col_names)

d[, trial := 1:.N]

```

- `trial`: Trial number.

- `cat`: Category label.

- `x`: The spatial frequency of the sine-wave grating.

- `y`: The orientation of the sine-wave grating.

- `resp`: The response made by the monkey (i.e., category A or B).

- `rt`: Reaction time (time from stimulus onset to button press).

- `phase`: Indicates the phase of the experiment. In `phase==2`, the category
  labels are swapped relative to `phase==1`.


## Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) data

- This data is from a motor learning and motor control experiment.

- On each trial, participants simply rested their hand in the middle of a desk,
  and then tried to move their hand quickly and accurately to a visual target
  somewhere on a circle centred at their hand position and with a radius of
  about 8 cm.

- We tested two different groups of people. One group were college students, and
  the other group were professional surgeons.

- The data file can be found here:
  https://crossley.github.io/cogs2020/data/mis/mis_data.csv


```{r message=F}

rm(list=ls())

d <- fread('https://crossley.github.io/cogs2020/data/mis/mis_data.csv')

```

- `subject`: Anonymous subject ID
- `group`: Indicates college student or surgeon
- `phase`: Indicates the phase of the experiment
- `trial`: Trial number
- `target`: The visual target was reached to for this trial
- `error`: The mismatch between the centre of the target and the final hand position
- `movement_time`: How long the movement lasted
- `reaction_time`: How long until the movement began
- `peak_velocity`: The maximum velocity reached during the reach


## MEG data
We also have magnetoencephalography (MEG) data collected from a single
participant while they performed a category learning experiment. On each trial
of the category learning experiment, the participant viewed a circular sine wave
grating, and had to push a button to indicate whether they believed the stimulus
belonged to category A or category B. We have seen and worked with this type of
category learning experiment many times throughout this course, and it is
further described by the following figure.

MEG is used to record the time-series of magnetic and electric potentials at the
scalp, which are generated by the activity of neurons. There are many sensors,
each configured to pick up signal from a different position on the scalp. This
is shown in the following figure (the text labels indicate the channel name and
are placed approximately where the MEG sensor is located on a real head).

The data file that we will be working with is arranged into *epochs* aligned to
stimulus presentation. This means that every time a stimulus is presented we say
that an epoch has occurred. We then assign a time of $t=0$ to the exact moment
the stimulus appeared. We then typically look at the neural time series from
just before the stimulus appeared to a little while after the stimulus has
appeared. For this data, each epoch starts 0.1 seconds before stimulus onset,
and concludes 0.3 seconds after stimulus onset. The following figure shows the
MEG signal at every sensory location across the entire scalp for 5 time points
within this $[-0.1s, 0.3s]$ interval.

The data can be located here:
`https://crossley.github.io/cogs2020/data/eeg/epochs.txt`

```{r message=F}

rm(list=ls())

## d <- fread('https://crossley.github.io/cogs2020/data/eeg/epochs.txt')

```

- The `time` column contains times in seconds relative to stimulus onset.
  Stimulus onset always occurs at $0$ seconds.

- The `condition` column indicates which category the stimulus belonged to for
  the given `epoch`. We won't make use of this column here, and we will remove
  it below.

- The `epoch` column is the epoch number. You can think of this like we have
  usually thought of `trial` columns in examples throughout the course.

- The many different `MEG xyz` columns contain the actual neural time series
  signals for each sensor. See the above figure for how these column names map
  onto scalp positions.
