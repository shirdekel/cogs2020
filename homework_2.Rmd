* Create a new file named `cogs2020_hw_2.R` and save it in
the `cogs2020` folder that you created during Lecture 1.

* Make the first line of your script `rm(list=ls())`. This
line of code will erase any variable defined before it. Do
not put this line of code after anything important that you
want to keep (e.g., so that I can mark your work).

* After `rm(list=ls())`, create a variable named `my_name`
and set its value equal to a **character** vector (i.e.,
letters surrounded by `""` or by `''`) containing your name.

* After `rm(list=ls())`, create a variable named
`my_student_id` and set its value equal to a **character**
vector (i.e., letters surrounded by `""` or by `''`)
containing your student id.

* So far, here is what your file should look like if your
name is `John Doe` and and your student ID is `12345678`.
```{r, echo=T}
rm(list=ls())
my_name <- "John Doe"
my_student_id <- "12345678"
```

## 1.
Consider an experiment designed to find out whether or not
feedback-delay impairs criterion learning? What is criterion
learning? Here is an example trial:

<center>
![FigName](img/cats.png){width=250px}
</center>

In this case, thin bars belong to category A, and thick bars
belong to category B. But where exactly is the category
boundary (i.e., criterion) that separates thick from thin?
Criterion learning is the process that allows our brains to
figure this out.   Next, you will perform a cursory analysis
on the data from this experiment.

**a.**
Read
`https://crossley.github.io/cogs2020/data/criterion_learning/crit_learn.csv`
into a `data.table` and store the result in a variable named
`ans_1a`.

The resulting `data.table` contains the following columns:

- `t`: Trial number across the entire experiment.

- `t_prob`: Trial number per problem.

- `sub`: Subject identifier (i.e., different numbers correspond to different
  subjects).

- `cnd`: Condition identifier.

- `prob_num`: Problem number (gets increased by 1 every time a participant
  solves a problem).

- `t2c`: Trials to criterion (i.e., the number of trials it took a participant
  to solve a particular problem.)

- `exp`: Experiment indicator. Overall, this study was broken down into two
  experiments -- one using sine-wave grating stimuli and the other using a
  different type of stimuli.

- `nps`: Number of problems solved. This is the same as `max(prob_num)`

**b.**
Select only rows for which `cnd == Delay` or for which
`cnd==Long ITI` and store the result in a new `data.table`
named `ans_1b`.

**c.**
Select only the columns `cnd`, `sub` and `t2c` columns and
store the result in a new `data.table` named `ans_1c`.

# TODO: here
Create a new `data.table` that contains only a `cnd`, `sub`
and mean `t2c` per `cnd` per `sub`, and store the result in
a variable named `ans_1c`.

* Make sure that your resulting `data.table` has only `cnd`,
`sub` and `t2c` columns and nothing more. Any columns named
`V1` etc. will lead to this question being marked
incorrect).

* Also make sure that your resulting `data.frame` only has
one observation per subject. Failure to do so will lead to
this question being marked incorrect.

A common error on these problem sets is to accidentally
erase or overwrite variables from one question with those
from another. Another common error is to name your variables
slightly wrong (e.g., `Ans_1a` instead of `ans_1a`). Yet
another common error is to include a line of code or two
that generates an error, and sometimes this error is serious
enough to prevent most or all of your script from running,
in which case you will lose most or all of your marks for
that assignment. All of these can be a very frustrating way
to lose marks, but you will indeed lose marks if you make
these mistakes, so you need to be very careful!

To ensure that this doesn't happen to you, please run your
entire `.R` script from start to finish. One way to do this
is to use `Code > Run Region > Run All`, but of course there
are shortcuts for everything so do as you wish. If there are
any errors at all when you do this, it is essential that you
address them.  

After all of your code has executed from start to finish
without and errors at all, then carefully inspect your
workspace to ensure that the following variables are
defined. A reasonable way to do this is to try to print each
one of these variables to the console. If it is defined,
then it will print without error.
```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
my_name
my_student_id
```
